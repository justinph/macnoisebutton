*  To get started, you need to make an account at the MAC Noise website. Its important you don't use this login/password anywhere else you'll share it with me.
*  Ok, here's the URL where you can sign up: https://www.macenvironment.org/customers/#new-account When you've created an account, reply with your username.
*  < RECIEVE USERNAME >
*  Ok, now reply with the password. Remember, don't use this password anywhere else since it will not be encrypted or protected! I don't want that responsibility.
*  < RECIEVE PASSWORD >
*  < VALIDATE PASSWORD > 
*  Fantastic! Your login info checks out. If you ever want to opt-out of this system, reply with "NUKE ME" an time we'll delete everything we know about you.
* * Drats! There seems to be a problem with your login. I've made my human aware of it, but maybe you can try again? Send me your username again.
* We're ready to make a complaint! Just text ✈️ or "COMPLAIN" and we'll do it. You can also send 😴 for too early/late, 🤢 for too frequent, and 👇for too low.

* Hmm. I didn't recognize that. Try ✈️ or "COMPLAIN" and we'll do it. You can also send 😴 for too early/late, 🤢 for too frequent, and 👇for too low. 

* HELP: ✈️ or "COMPLAIN" for too loud, 😴 for too early/late, 🤢 for too frequent, and 👇for too low. Or "NUKE ME" and we'll forget all about you.
